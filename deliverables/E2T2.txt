Some of the Config's non-compliant rules are related to the CloudFormation code
we deployed. Examples include the EC2 instances not being configured to use Instance 
Metadata Service Version 2 (IMSV2), EC2 instances having a public IP address, EC2 instances
not configured to use Systems Manager, and the S3 buckets not having a lifecycle policy
enabled. We can address these non-compliant rules by configuring the instances to use
IMSV2, putting the instances behind load balancers and removing the public IP addresses,
configure instances to use the Systems Manager, and adding a lifecycle policy to the
recipe S3 buckets.  

All Inspector findings are related to the CloudFormation code we deployed. We
should eliminate the web services's inbound rules allowing traffic from anywhere
except from the application load balancer security group.

All three high-severity issues that Security Hub found are related to the CloudFormation
code. We should fix these by removing SSH access to our instances, instead using immutable
instances; changing the default security group in our VPC to restrict all traffic; and 
removing the security group inbound and outbound rules that allow all traffic on all ports
from all protocols.
