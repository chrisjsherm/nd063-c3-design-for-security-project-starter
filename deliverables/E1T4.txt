The Web Service Instance sits behind the Application Load Balancer. The load 
balancer communicates with the web service on port 5000. This means the web 
service does not need to have an ingress on port 80, yet its security group has 
port 80 open to the entire Internet. We should remove the ingress for port 80. 
We should also limit the ingress for port 5000 to the load balancer security 
group. We should especially remove the ingress rule allowing all traffic from 
all protocols and port ranges from the Internet. Additionally, the web service 
has an ingress on port 22 for SSH, and this ingress is available to the 
Internet. We can eliminate the need for this ingress entirely by using the 
immutable instance strategyâ€”provisioning a new instance of the web service when 
we need to make changes and terminating the existing instance once the new 
instance is running. Now we can remove the Elastic IP assigned to the 
web service instance. To provide additional security for the web service, we can 
redeploy it in a private subnet since only the load balancer within our VPC 
needs access. Thus far there has been no documented need for the web service to 
establish outbound connections, so we should eliminate the egress rule that 
allows access to the Internet on all ports from all protocols.

A second bad practice is the configuration of the default security group. The 
default security group allows all traffic using all protocols on all ports. The 
default security group should restrict all inbound and outbound traffic, forcing 
us to configure access using the least-privilege principle.
