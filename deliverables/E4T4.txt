1. We can reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application
instance by terminating the instance in the public subnet and starting a new
instance in the private subnet. Even if we do not have security groups
properly configured, no attacks originating from the internet should be able to
reach the instance in the private subnet.

2. No, creating an S3 VPC endpoint would route traffic between the subnet and
S3 within the AWS network, but it would not prevent an S3 bucket with public
access from being accessed from the internet.

3. No, applying default encryption does not encrypt existing data.

4. The original CloudFormation templates will overwrite changes to the template
made in the Console or via the CLI. However, if I make changes directly to a 
resource, CloudFormation will not overwrite my changes because it will not detect
a change in the template, and it does not take action when there are no template
changes.
